# [I Like Rauhuts](https://i-like-rauhuts.mybluemix.net/)

This was a wedding website I made for the love of my life.

It started with the idea of creating her a pop-up storybook for our big day.

It is also a [progressive web app](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/) because why not.

## To Develop

2. `yarn install` or `npm install`
3. `yarn start` or `npm start`

## To Deploy to Bluemix

1. Edit the `./manifest.yml` with a unique name for your Bluemix app.
2. Figure out how to use Bluemix with the Cloud Foundry CLI, [yeah](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/cli/index.html#cli)
2. `cf push`

## Open-Source License

**Is it weird I gave our wedding website an open-source license?**

Yes.

**Are you able to use it within the limits of MIT?**

Yeah.

**Should you use this website as a learning tool?**

Absolutely.

**Should you use this as your own wedding website to gift to a lift a loved one?**

That is kind of weird, but okay.
